The Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) is an open System-on-Chip bus protocol for high performance buses to communicate with low-power devices. In the AMBA High-performance Bus (AHB) a system bus is used to connect a processor, a DSP, and high-performance memory controllers where as the AMBA Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) is used to connect (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) UART. It also contains a Bridge, which connects the AHB and APB buses. Bridges are standard bus-to-bus interfaces that allow IPs connected to different buses to communicate with each other in a standardized way.
